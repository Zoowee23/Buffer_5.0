"CRIME RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM" : helps law enforcement agencies manage crime records efficiently. This system allows easy recording, updating, and querying of crime data, enabling quick access for law enforcement personnel. The goal is to streamline the management of crime-related information and ensure swift retrieval of relevant data.

DATA STRUCTURES USED: Our project employs hashmaps to efficiently associate the names of individuals filing complaints with their respective crime IDs. Additionally, we utilize array lists to systematically catalog the names of all accused criminals. This approach enhances organizational structure and facilitates streamlined access to pertinent information within our system.
